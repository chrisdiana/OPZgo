>Ultra-portable backups for Teenage Engineering's OP-Z

Inspired by [tacoe's OP1GO](https://github.com/tacoe/OP1GO), this small script allows for full OP-Z backups while on the go using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Simply plug your OP-Z into the Pi Zero and it will automatically create a timestamped full backup of your OP-Z including any projects, sample packs, bounces and configurations.

### What's needed

* OP-Z
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Micro SD Card (at least 4GB)
* USB-C to USB micro cable
* USB-A to USB micro cable (for power)
* Power source (i.e. power adapter, power bank)

## Setup

1. Prepare SD Card

* Download the latest [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
* Flash the Raspian image to your Micro SD card. [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is a great choice.
* Pop the SD into your Pi Zero and boot it up.  

2. Configure the Pi

* Login using the default password `raspberry`.
* Run `sudo raspi-config` 
* Inside the configuration menu you'll probably want to change your password using `Option 1 (Change User Password)`. Then, navigate back the the main screen.
* Next, you'll want to connect to the internet. Select `Option 2 (Network Options)` and then select `N2 Wi-fi` to enter your network name and password.
* Navigate back to the main screen and click `<Finish>` to exit the configuration menu.
* It should then prompt you to reboot your Pi Zero. If not, reboot it using `sudo reboot`.

3. Setup OPZgo

Once booted back up, run the following commands to setup OPZgo:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone git@github.com:chrisdiana/OPZgo.git
$ cd OPZgo/
$ sudo sh setup.sh
```

Finally we're going to make the script run every time the Pi Zero starts.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add a new line `sudo python3 /home/pi/OPZgo/opzgo.py &` (towards the end of the file, before the `exit` statement) and then save. Now you can unplug your Pi as it's ready to start making backups!


## Usage

1. Plug in your Pi to a power source and wait for it to boot up (the green LED should stop blinking once fully booted).
2. Plug in your OP-Z and put it into [Content Mode](https://teenage.engineering/guides/op-z/disk-modes) by holding the Track button while turning on the unit.
3. The Pi's LED will then blink 5 times indicating the backup process has begun.
4. Once the backup process is finished, the Pi's LED will break and then start blinking rapidly to signal the backup has completed. The OP-Z will be automatically unmounted and ejected. You should see the OP-Z reboot into normal mode. It's now safe to disconnect the OP-Z.


## Accessing Backups

Backups will be saved to `/opzgo/backups/`. Within that folder, backups are saved as timestamped directories each time you trigger a backup. You can access them by either SSH'ing into the Pi or by using a convenient tool like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) to easily connect to your Pi and interact like you would a FTP server.


### Troubleshooting & a few things to note

* Sometimes the OP-Z will fail to connect or mount. If after a long time (>10 minutes) you still don't see the series of LED patterns described above, do NOT assume the backup was successful. Try unplugging the power from the Pi, reboot and try again.

* The script will only backup once per boot so if you want to backup again you will have to restart the process.

* This software is provided "as is", without warranty.
